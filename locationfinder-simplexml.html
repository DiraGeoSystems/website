            <h2 class="text-center">The "Simple Xml" Format</h2>
            <h4 class="text-center">The standard input format for LocationFinder’s Builder</h4>
            <br>

            <p> The “Simple XML” format is a way to store locations in an XML format that the LocationFinder’s
                Builder application can read. A “Simple XML” file contains one or more locations. A location
                describes a named place, such as an address, a street intersection, or any “point of interest”. Each
                location has a centre (x and y coordinates) and/or an extent (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax coordinates), as
                well as arbitrary fields. Each field is a name=value pair, the name consisting of letters only. </p>

            <h3> Structure </h3>
            <p> The XML declaration is optional but recommended. Be sure to specify the correct encoding and use
                an encoding that is known by .NET. We recommend using UTF-8 (as shown in the example below).
                <br>
                The root element can have any name; this name is ignored. The root element may have an attribute
                sref that states the spatial reference in a format that the LocationFinder can understand (try using
                the spatial reference’s WKID (well-known id) as assigned by EPSG, for example, sref="4326" would
                be for WGS 1984 coordinates). This attribute is optional. Need at least LocationFinder 1.8.
                <br>
                Each element within the root element describes one location. The element’s name is the location’s
                type (unless overridden by an attribute or a sub-element named type). Each attribute becomes a
                field of the location (unless overridden by a sub-element).
                <br>
                Each sub-element becomes a field of the location: the element’s name is the field’s name, and the
                element’s text content is the field’s value. If a sub-element has the same name as an attribute, the
                element overrides the attribute. The name should consist of letters only.
                <br>
                Each location must have a centre and/or an extent. Two fields named x and y specify the centre.
                Four fields named xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax specify the extent. The value of these fields must be a
                decimal number with optional decimal point (not comma), optional leading minus sign, and no
                thousand’s separators. Depending on data’s spatial reference, the x coordinate is a longitude or an
                easting, and the y coordinate is a latitude or a northing. </p>

            <h3> Example </h3>
            <div class="code-box">
    <pre><code>
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?> XML declaration
          <Root sref="4326"> root element (optinal sref since v1.8)
          <poi state="VA"> the 1st location
          <name>Empire State Building</name>
          <state>NY</state>
          <x>1234.5</x>
          <y>2345.6</y>
          </poi>
          <Location type="adr"> the 2nd location
          <hnr>13a</hnr>
          <str>High Street</str>
          <zip>54321</zip>
            <city>Hamilton</city>
          <x>888.88</x>
          <y>999.99</y>
          </Location>
          </Root>

    </code></pre>
            </div>

            <p>The XML above describes two locations. The first location has type “poi” (from the element name)
                and these fields: name=Empire State Building, state=NY (the element overrides the attribute), and
                centre=(1234.5, 2345.6). The second location has type “adr” (from the type attribute) and these
                fields: hnr=13a, str=High Street, zip=54321, city=Hamilton, and centre=(888.88, 999.99).</p>
