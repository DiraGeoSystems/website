All proportions and values are approximate.

The needle shall neither be too nearly vertical nor
at right angle to the Earth axis; the angle chosen
above looks ``about right.''
Note that $23.4^\circ$ is the tilt of the Earth axis
and should look about right.

Colors: the needle in ``Dira blue,'' all the rest in full black.
