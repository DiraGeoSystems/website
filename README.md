# The Dira Beta Page

This is the development page of Dira GeoSystems.

It uses bootstrap and jekyll.

The page is automatically built upon a push to github.

## Develop

If you want to have local previews, create a jekyll docker container by using the included docker-compose.yml. Go to the root of this repository and run:

`docker-compose up`

The site will be available under `locallhost:4000` approximatley 4sek after saving your edits in your editor.
